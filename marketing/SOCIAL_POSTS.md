1/ Introducing BibsClaw - my personal AI assistant with 5 AI models, voice interface, and autonomous coding agent. Built it solo from Abu Dhabi.

2/ It routes your questions to the right AI model automatically - quick facts to Perplexity, complex reasoning to Claude, creative work to GPT-4o.

3/ The voice interface supports wake word detection (Hey BibsClaw), 4 languages, and streams responses sentence-by-sentence.

4/ The coding agent has 30+ tools and can read files, write code, run git commands, scrape web, and automate browser tasks autonomously.

5/ Schedule any task with cron, webhooks, or event triggers. Access it from web, Telegram, Slack, Discord, or CLI.

6/ It is open source. Star it on GitHub: github.com/bibinsmart007/bibsclaw
