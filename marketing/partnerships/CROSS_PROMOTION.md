Subject: Partnership Opportunity - BibsClaw AI

Hi [Name],

I am Bibin, founder of BibsClaw - an AI assistant that integrates Perplexity for real-time search, Telegram bot access, and voice interfaces.

I think there is a great opportunity for cross-promotion between our projects. Our users overlap in the AI developer tools space.

Proposed collaboration:
- Featured in each others newsletters/socials
- Joint blog post or tutorial
- Integration showcase

Would you be open to a quick chat?

Best, Bibin
